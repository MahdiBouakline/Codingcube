I have the Pyraminx duo. I am very able to solve it and I use the intermediate method.

Ao5=1 minute and 30 seconds.

Ao12=1 minute and 13 seconds.

Ao25=55 seconds.


The big issue that occured was the lack of concentration initially. When I first took on this challenge, I had a lack of focus and often took longer than 5 minutes to complete it. I decided to turn off all distractions and focus immediately.
