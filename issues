#Big issues!

The bggest issues I had was difficulty with rotating the cube, and lack of concentration.

For starters, getting used to how the cube spins and turns was the most difficult, as it was different from the basic 3X3 that I was used to. I overcame this by practicing longer with it during class, until I was quite comfortable when we went home.

The second and final issue I had, was lack of concentration. When I first got my cube, I got distracted easily and couldn't focus. I overcame this by getting rid of all distractions.
